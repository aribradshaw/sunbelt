    <h1>Test Dial Page Fix</h1>
    <p>This page tests if the Dial page is now showing the card view instead of the spreadsheet view.</p>
    
    <h2>What Was Fixed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Removed conditional rendering logic that was causing table view</li>
        <li>✅ Forced Dial page to always show card view</li>
        <li>✅ Cleaned up unused filter and sort logic</li>
        <li>✅ Simplified the component to focus on phone banking functionality</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Test Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the main app and log in as South Amherst</li>
        <li>Go to the Dial tab</li>
        <li>You should see cards with phone numbers, not a spreadsheet</li>
        <li>Each card should show:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Person's name and address</li>
            <li>Phone numbers (Main, Alt 1, Alt 2 if different)</li>
            <li>Status checkboxes (Confirmed, Texted, Mailed)</li>
            <li>Party affiliation icon</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Expected Results:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Cards should be displayed in a grid layout</li>
        <li>✅ Only people with phone numbers should be shown</li>
        <li>✅ Phone numbers should be clickable (tel: links)</li>
        <li>✅ Checkboxes should work and persist to CSV</li>
        <li>✅ Search should work to filter the cards</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Previous Issue:</h2>
    <p>The Dial page was showing a spreadsheet/table view instead of the intended card view because the conditional rendering logic was falling through to the default table view.</p>
    
    <h2>Solution:</h2>
    <p>Simplified the component to always show the card view since the Dial page is specifically designed for South Amherst phone banking data.</p>
